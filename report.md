So far I have learned that creating software isn't a task that you wake up and do. This includes a whole system of steps that ensure that our software is well built and addresses and provides a solution to the problem. I have learnt that Git plays a huge role in software development in this era as it allows team building and as you are able to create portfolios which will make us relevant to the market.
